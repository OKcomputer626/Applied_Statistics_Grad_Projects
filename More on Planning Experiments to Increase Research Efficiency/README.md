# More on Planning Experiments to Increase Reasearch Efficiency
## Experimental Design & Analysis
This project presented the effects of planning eperiments to increase research efficiency from our assigned homework problem (8.11 in the Design and analysis of Experiments eighth edition by Douglas C. Montgomery) in class. It is an article in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry that uses a 2^(k-2) desing to investigate the effect of different factors.

# Methodology and SAS Procedures Implemented
## One-Quarter Fractiona of 2^(k-2) Factorial
* data steps and structure
* proc sql
## Analysis of Variance
* Estimates of the effects
* Sum of Squares
* Degrees of Freedom
* Test Hypothesis
* F observation and F critical value test
* Residual plot
# Project Procedures
## Design 
Constructed the design of reslution III it requires the minimum length of the letter pattern of the generators using five factors and two generators to assess the experiment. 
## Analysis of Variance
Will not include the interaction effects of the model, so instead they will be calculuated as error.
# Results
After our analysis was complete, there were no effect onto the model, so the model is not significant which means that there are no factors in the model can increase research efficiency. Therefore, the experiment needs more on planning experiments using different effect factors to increase reasearch efficiency and create a model for it.
