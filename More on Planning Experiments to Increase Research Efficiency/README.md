# More on Planning Experiments to Increase Reasearch Efficiency
## Experimental Design & Analysis
This project presented the effects of planning eperiments to increase research efficiency from our assigned homework problem (8.11 in the Design and analysis of Experiments eighth edition by Douglas C. Montgomery) in class. It is an article in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry that uses a 2^(k-2) desing to investigate the effect of different factors.
