## Introduction to R Programming

This group project presented Disney movies total gross which contains the total gross revenue of Walt Disney Studios Movies from 1937 to 2016 and Disney revenue which contains the revenue of the Walt Disney Company from 1992 to 2016. The subset included the years 1992 to 2016 where both data sets overlapped each other. 

### My Contributions to the project:

* R Programming:
  * ggplot (tidyverse)
  * gt table chart
  * linear model function
* Report:
  * Data Description
  * Questions of Interest
  * Regression Analysis, Results and Interpretation
  * Conclusion

# Methodology and R Procedures Implemented

## Analysis

* Stepwise Regression AIC
* Interaction Effects
* Test Hypothesis

## Testing for Line Assumptions

* Residual Plot:
  * Check for Pattern
  * Equal Variance
* Normality:
  * Shapiro Test
  * QQ-Plot

# Results

We can successfully predict  Disneyâ€™s annual total revenue by counting the number of total movies released each year and counting the number of comedy movies released each year. Hence, there were only 2 variables of interest that will sufficiently predict total revenue as nor interaction terms were needed and transformation required.
