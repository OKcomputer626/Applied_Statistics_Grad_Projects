# Life Expectancy

## Regression Analysis

This group project presented health-related data from the World Health Organization repository,
and was merged with economic-related data from the United Nations website.The data was made public in order to help countries improve their citizens' life expectancy.
The data set contains 22 variables to summarize data for 193 countries between the years of 2000 and 2015.

# Results
After our analysis was complete, the results of the model can be used by developing countries to determine which sections of their economy and healthcare they should focus on to improve the life expectancy of its citizens.
However, the data was from 8 years ago and was from before the global pandemic and major supply chain disruption in recent years.
The analysis could be improved and made more applicable by including data from more recent years.
